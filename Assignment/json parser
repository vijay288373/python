# JSON Parser: Design a Python program that reads JSON data from a file and extracts specific information, such as nested dictionaries or lists, and presents it in a structured format.

import json

def parse_json_file(filename):
  with open(filename, 'r') as f:
    data = json.load(f)
  return data

def extract_information(data, keys):
  extracted_data = {}
  for key in keys:
    if key in data:
      extracted_data[key] = data[key]
  return extracted_data

# Example usage
filename = 'data.json'  # Replace with your JSON file
keys_to_extract = ['name', 'address', 'orders']

data = parse_json_file(filename)
extracted_data = extract_information(data, keys_to_extract)

print(json.dumps(extracted_data, indent=2))
